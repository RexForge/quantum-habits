# Development Plan - Awaiting Task

## Status
Ready for task input from user.

## Next Steps
Waiting for user to specify:
- What feature to build
- What bug to fix
- What improvement to make
- What to refactor

Once a concrete task is provided, the planning workflow will proceed with:
1. Codebase exploration using explorer agents
2. Clarifying questions if needed
3. Detailed implementation plan
4. Final review and approval

---
*Plan will be updated once user provides a specific task or feature request.*
